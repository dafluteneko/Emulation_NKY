# My Compatibility List

My own compatibility list: All the information here is related to my own devices and my experience with the emulators, games (and the systems I use).

Do not use this list as a indication to whether or not the games, emulators, etc will work for you. This is called **My Compatibility List** for a reason.
You're free to explore, though.

## Devices
