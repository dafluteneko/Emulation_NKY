# Crash Bandicoot: Warped

## Emulators

### DuckStation

- **Compatibility**: Perfect
- **Settings**: Default (or Any)

Found no issue while tweaking settings\*:

- All renderers worked as intended
- My iCPU and iGPU works as intended with any setting

\* Note: There is a chance that a setting or two could break the way the game is displayed or even performance. For example, running _Internal Resolution_ at `32x` (which is beyond reasonable). The setting 99% of users will use and maybe tweak work out of the box.
